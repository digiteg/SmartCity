# **Part 1 - Pyboard simple examples in Micropython**

I was digging on internet for some examples about testing on ESP8266 in Micropython just for myself education purpose and I didn't find too much useful examples for me. So I decided to fill this gap and I hope this can be  also useful for others who are willing to deal with the topic or teach their students about basics and how to automate testing. Why ESP8266 ? Because it is cost-effective and highly integrated Wi-Fi MCU for IoT / smart things... applications


Thanks to the success of Python as a programming language, today many developers have chosen this language in their projects and more and more people are familiar with and experience this language. So why microcontrollers are still programmed in C?

Well, things seem to be taking another direction. MicroPython has been released, a development software that allows the programming of microcontrollers using exclusively Python as a programming language. In this article we will see in detail MicroPython. We will also talk about PyBoard, a microcontroller board specifically designed to be programmed into Python.


MicroPython is an application based entirely on Python 3. This application allows all developers to program microcontrollers using some Python libraries that have been optimized to work on microprocessors normally mounted on microcontrollers.

The development on MicroPython is really simple. It does not require any installation, just open the corresponding web page (see here) on the official micropython.org website. In fact MicroPython is an application that works online, and so instead of installing an application on your computer you can work directly from the browser.
