C and C++ are common programming languages used in microcomputers and embedded devices, but they are also relatively high learning barriers for beginners in programming. Using the programming language processor ' MicroPython ' that is highly compatible with Python 3, you can easily program a microcomputer using the Python 3 grammar that is easy for beginners to understand.

MicroPython is a language processing system that allows programming of microcomputers and embedded devices using Python grammar. The code coverage rate showing the percentage of source code tested is 98.4% for the core part, and it corresponds to the instruction set such as x86 , ARM , Xtensa .

Thanks to the success of Python as a programming language, today many developers have chosen this language in their projects and more and more people are familiar with and experience this language. So why microcontrollers are still programmed in C?

Well, things seem to be taking another direction. MicroPython has been released, a development software that allows the programming of microcontrollers using exclusively Python as a programming language. In this article we will see in detail MicroPython. We will also talk about PyBoard, a microcontroller board specifically designed to be programmed into Python.
