# **Virtual prototyping for IoT - Smart city**
C and C++ are common programming languages used in microcomputers and IoT embedded devices, but they are also relatively high learning barriers for beginners in programming. Using the programming language processor ' MicroPython ' that is highly compatible with Python 3, you can easily program a microcomputer using the Python 3 grammar that is easy for beginners to understand.

The code coverage rate showing the percentage of source code tested is 98.4% for the core part, and it corresponds to the instruction set such as x86 , ARM , Xtensa .



- **Part 1** [in this tutorial I will cover simple prototyping with PyBoard and virtual environment Unicorn in MicroPython](/Part1/README.md)

- **Part 2** [in this tutorial I will show more complex work with Sense HAT and Trinket in Python](/Part2/README.md)
