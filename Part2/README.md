# What is a Sense HAT?


The Sense HAT is an add-on board for the Raspberry Pi, made especially for the Astro Pi competition. The board allows you to make measurements of temperature, humidity, pressure, and orientation, and to output information using its built-in LED matrix.

## **Trinket’s online dev environment **
Trinket lets you run and write code in any browser, on any device. Trinkets work instantly, with no need to log in, download plugins, or install software. Easily share or embed the code with your changes when you're done.

![Trinket emulator](/img/Emulator.png)
The new emulator builds on Trinket’s existing Python-in-browser platform, and provides the following features:

- Virtual Sense HAT with environmental controls and joystick input
- Full Python syntax highlighting
- Contextual auto-complete
- Intuitive error reporting and highlighting
- Image upload
- HTML page embedding
- Social media integration
- Project sharing via direct URL
- Project download as zip (for moving to Raspberry Pi)
- All major browsers supported



The Sense HAT has temperature, pressure and humidity sensors, and can change its behaviour according to the values they report. The Sense HAT emulator has sliders you can move to change these values, so you can test how your code responds to environmental variables.

## **Back to reality .. Start with baby steps**
Idea is to start always with small building blocks and try to test them and optimize your code. This is the best way how to build your solution iteratively and step by step learn how things work.

Try to copy and paste following code examples into Unicorn REPL


## Step 1: your first code Internal USR button and LEDs

In example 

```python

```


## Step 2: second code try Pin attached virtual LED

In example we will use 

```python

```

## Step 3: next code 

```python

```

## Step 4: next code will 

```python


```

# Next steps

In second part of this tutorial I will cover complex scenario and related topics
